                New, with tag
                A never-worn item with tag is an item which has never been worn and still has the original purchase hangtags on it 

                Never worn
                Items have never been worn and are as good as brand new, with no tag 

                Pristine
                Items have been worn once or twice but are still in excellent condition.

                Good
                Items have been worn but still look great.

                Fair 
                Item has been worn frequently and shows defects (these are mentioned in the description and visible in photos)

                Vintage
                Condition is relative to age, since imperfections are what give vintage pieces their special character.
